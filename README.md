# Source Code Analyzer

### A simple application that takes an input of a source file, and outputs total number of lines, number of comments, single line comments, multi-line comments, and TODO statements in comments.

To use the application follow these steps:
 1. execute the CodeAnalyzer.java file. This will prompt the user to give the source file to be analyzed. 
 2. After the application completes its analysis, it will write out the results to console, as well as to a file in the same directory as the source file, and with the same name, save for having "Results" appended to it.

*Note*: The application was made using Test Driven Development, and as such, tests for each class exist in the /testsrc folder, and where applicable, these test cases call upon files in the /testfiles folder
